# WakeUpMoto
I've made this app because even though Motorola One Zoom has a notification LED, it lights up only once when a notification arrives. This means that if the phone is sitting on a desk for long periods of time, I can easily miss the alert when I don't pay attention and I have to constanly check if I did.

To mitigate this problem I've made this simple app that after a notification arrives, preiodicaly lights up the screen to catch my attention until the phone is moved or picked up.

To build the app you need
```
Android Studio 4.0
Build #AI-193.6911.18.40.6514223, built on May 20, 2020
Runtime version: 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b01 amd64
```
 - the Motorola OEM USB drivers for the phone from https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb
 - and the phone in development mode by tapping 10 times `Build number` in `Settings > System > About phone`

# Privacy
This app does not collect any user personal data.
It only monitors motion/gesture sensors to determine if the display was turned on by a missed notification or user approching the device, and listens for android.intent.action.PHONE_STATE TelephonyManager.EXTRA_STATE_OFFHOOK to determine if the incoming phone call was answered or missed.
